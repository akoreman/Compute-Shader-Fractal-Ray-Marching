# Compute Shader Ray Marching
WIP. Working on a program to use ray marching to render 3D fractals composed of folded primitives. Implemented using compute shaders through Unity3D.

**Currently Implemented:**
- Unlit rendering of fractals composed of translated primitives.

**To do:**
- Lit shading.
- Glow/ambient occlusion.
