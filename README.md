# Compute Shader Ray Marching
Work In Progress. Working on a program to use ray marching to render in real-time 3D fractals composed of folded primitives. Implemented using HLSL compute shaders through Unity3D. Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svLzmFuSBhk .

**Currently Implemented:**
- Unlit rendering of fractals composed of translated primitives.
- Glow implemented by visualising how close non-hitting rays come to the object.

**To do:**
- Lit shading.
- Ambient occlusion.
